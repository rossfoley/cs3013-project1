We have, for the most part, completed phase 1 (runCommand.c) and phase 2 (shell.c). Since archiving these versions into this .zip file, we have made a bit of progress on allowing files to be read in to shell.c. We are still getting a few errors though, so we decided not to update the .zip files. As for testing, we ourselves have done plenty on the two programs but have not yet recorded our findings. We plan on doing that before proceeding to phase 3.
